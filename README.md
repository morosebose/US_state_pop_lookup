# US State Population Lookup
Lets the user look up population data for US states.

## Overview
This program presents population data from the USDA to the user. The user has 3 ways to look up state population:
- Show states and population for a specific year, sorted by population
- Show states with positive or negative growth rate, sorted by state name
- Show whether there is a drop in state population between 2 years.

## Program Files
The program consists of the following files:
- This README file has general information
- `lab1.docx` contains the program specs and requirements
- `statesPop.csv` has [population data from the USDA](https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17827)
- `states.py` has the back end code to access the data in the USDA file
- `ui.py` presents a menu to the user and displays the population data based on the user's choice.
Running the program creates an additional file:
- `logfile.txt` logs the back end function calls and results.

## Downloading and Running the Program
The program requires that python already be installed on your local machine. If you do not have python installed, you can download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Follow these steps after installing python:
- Click on the green `Code` button above this README
  - If you don't see the button, [go to the main page for this repo](https://github.com/morosebose/us_state_pop_lookup) and try again
- From the menu that opens, choose `Download ZIP`
- On the local machine, uncompress the ZIP file to a location of your choice
- Launch a command line prompt such as Terminal, PowerShell, or Windows Command. 
- At the command line prompt, type `python ui.py` to launch the program.
  - On some systems, you may instead need to type `python3 ui.py`
The UI will launch and you can view the population data by making a menu choice.
